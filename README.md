# Predictive-Modeling-to-Optimize-Fitness-Class-Capacity
Predictive Modeling to Optimize Class Capacity at GoalZone Fitness 

Objective,
The goal is to build Predictive modeling to optimize fitness class capacity at GoalZone.
GoalZone is a fitness club chain in Canada. GoalZone offers a range of fitness classes in two capacities - 25 and 15. Some classes are always fully booked. 

Business Problem,
Fully booked classes often have a low attendance rate. GoalZone wants to increase the number of spaces available for classes. They want to do this by predicting whether the member will attend the class or not. If they can predict a member will not attend the class, they can make another space available.

Expectation, Comeout with predictive outcome to identify and communicate business implication.
